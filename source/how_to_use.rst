How to Use the Catalog
======================

This page provides a brief description of how to interact with and obtain the data in the
catalog. There is a hierarchy of three page types to work with: the "set page", the "simulation
page", and the "epoch page".

The Set Page
------------

The "set page" describes the general characteristics of a set of simulations from a particular
investigation and provides links to the individual simulations. This page provides links to
original journal articles which the simulation data appeared in, as well as basic characteristics
of the simulation data including the size of the domain, the finest cell size, the characteristic
mass of the clusters, etc.

The set pages are all linked to from :ref:`simulations`.

The Simulation Page
-------------------

Clicking on a particular simulation's link from the set page will take you to a "simulation page" 
which shows various quantities projected along the z-axis for every epoch of the simulation that 
is available. The different epochs can be navigated using the slider bar. The buttons above 
the slider bar can be used to look at the same images from a different line of sight. You 
can click on a particular set of images to get you to the images and files for a particular epoch. 

The Epoch Page
--------------

This page is where you can examine images from a particular simulation epoch in more detail and
obtain data. From this page you can:

1. Examine the images: Look at the images for the various slices and projections. Clicking on any
   image will enlarge it.
2. Download FITS files: Download links are provided for all of the FITS files for this particular
   epoch. 
3. Choose a projection direction: For the projected fields, changing the projection axis on the 
   drop-down menu will update the images for the projected fields as well as the links to the 
   FITS files. 
4. Open FITS files in JS9: Various links are provided for opening a FITS file in the JS9 window at 
   the bottom of the page. The drop-down menu above the JS9 window allows one to navigate between
   the different HDUs in the file.
